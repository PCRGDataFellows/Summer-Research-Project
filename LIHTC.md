# Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)
The goal of the LIHTC research project is to gain a better understanding of the neighborhoods where LIHTC developments are located. The majority of the analysis is at the census tract level, but I would like the report to provide the neighborhood perspective as well. Since the LIHTC program has been around since 1987, the goal isnâ€™t to understand where developers decide to build LIHTC developments but to get a comprehensive view of the factors present tenants of any LIHTC development in Allegheny County live with in their day-to-day life. Factors of interest include:
1. Vacant Property Rate
2. Rate of Residential Buildings Built Prior to 1950
3. Rate of Residential Buildings in Poor Condition
4. Rate of Housing Choice Voucher Usage
5. Owner Occupancy Rate
6. Rate of Subsidized Housing
7. Rate of Mortgage Foreclosures
8. Family Poverty Rate
9. Rate of Single Mothers
10. Rate of Those 25 and Up Without At Least a Bachelor's Degree
11. Male Unemployment/Unattachment Rate
12. Average 911 Dispatches for Shots Fired per 500
13. Median Gross Rent
14. Median Home Value
15. Racial and Ethnic Population Rates
16. Prevelance of Types of Building Violations
17. Prevelance of Types of Building Permits

These factors are analyzed with all LIHTC developments in Allegheny County but also with LIHTC data subsets based on development type (studio, 1 br, 2 br, 3 br, or 4 br) and development age (1987-2009 and 2010-present).
