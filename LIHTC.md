# Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)
The goal of the LIHTC research project is to gain a better understanding of the neighborhoods where LIHTC developments are located. The majority of the analysis is at the census tract level, but I would like the report to provide the neighborhood perspective as well. Since the LIHTC program has been around since 1987, the goal isnâ€™t to understand where developers decide to build LIHTC developments but to get a comprehensive view of the factors present tenants of any LIHTC development in Allegheny County live with in their day-to-day life. Factors of interest include:
1. vacancy rates
2. property condition
3. property age
4. median rent
5. median home value
6. poverty rate
7. violation rate
8. type of permit
These factors are analyzed with all LIHTC developments in Allegheny County but also with LIHTC data subsets based on development type (studio, 1 br, 2 br, 3 br, or 4 br) and development age (1987-2009 and 2010-present).
